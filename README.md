# ClojureScript -> Lumo -> ReactNative -> Expo

Just a little HelloWorld to proof the power of bootstrapped CLJS for building native Apps. Inspiration taken from [JUX Blog](https://juxt.pro/blog/posts/native.html)
[Support LUMO!!!](https://anmonteiro.com/2017/05/on-lumos-growth-and-sustainability/)

There is a [Expo CLJS template](https://github.com/tiensonqin/exponent-cljs-template) for builds with leiningen or boot which will inevitable spawn a JVM. I'd better stick without it.

```
npm i -g lumo-cljs
lumo -c src build.cljs
exp start
```
